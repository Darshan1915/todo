id
The id attribute is used to assign a unique name to an element on a web page. We can assign an id to the paragraph tag and use it to 
apply a specific style to that particular tag.

Example
<p id="para">This is a paragraph text.</p>
In the above example, we assign an id attribute to the p tag with a value para. In CSS and JavaScript, we can use the name para to 
access the specific p tag whose id value is set to the name para.

Note: The id attribute can be used on any tag to assign a unique tag name. It must be unique for each tag, meaning we can't use the 
same id name for another tag in an HTML document.

class
The class attribute is used to define a group of elements and to apply a specific style to that group. We can define a class for the 
paragraph tags and use it to apply a specific style to all the paragraph tags that belong to a particular class.

Example
<p class="info">This is a paragraph text.
<p class="info">This is another paragraph text.</p>
In the above example, both p tags have the same class name, info. If any CSS style is applied to the class name info, it will be 
applied on both p tags.

Note: The class attribute can be used on any tag to assign a group name to the tag.
