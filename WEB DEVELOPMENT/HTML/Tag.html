There are 2 types of tag 
1. Empty tag
2. Non-empty tag


**Empty tag:-An empty tag in HTML is a tag that has only an opening tag but no closing tag because it does not contain any content. 
Instead, the entire tag is self-contained and includes any necessary attributes or parameters within the opening tag. Empty tags are 
also known as self-closing or void or single or non-nested tags.

<br> : Use to insert a line break.
<hr> : Use to insert a horizontal line.
<img> : Use to insert an image.
<input> : Use to insert an input field.
<meta> : Use to insert meta-information about the html document.
<link> : Use to insert a link to an external resource such as a stylesheet.


**Non-Empty tag:-
A non-empty tag in HTML is a tag that has the content between its opening and closing tags. The content can include text, other 
HTML elements, or a combination of both. Non-empty tags are also called container or parent or nested tags because they contain 
other HTML elements within them.

Some examples of non-empty tags in HTML are:

<p> </p> : This tag is used to define a paragraph of text. The text is placed between the opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
<b> </b> : This tag is used to define bold text. The text is placed between the opening <b> and closing </b> tags.
<i> </i> : This tag is used to define italic text. The text is placed between the opening <i> and closing </i> tags.
